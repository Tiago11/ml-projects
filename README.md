# Machine Learning little projects
Some experiments with Machine Learning to build text classifiers using **python** and **scikit-learn**.

We have two projects:

* 20 Newsgroups

 Classify text into 5 topics using the 20_newsgroups dataset for training.

* REUTERS-21578

 Multi-label classifier, classifies text into 3 topics where the text could have more than one topic. It uses the REUTERS-21578 dataset for training.
